# Selection Sort Algorithm

# The algorithm is splitting the array to sorted and unsorted parts, setting a marker where the unsorted subarray begins. It is iterating over the unsorted subarray to find the number with minimum value and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted subarray, them moves the mark with one position. The process is repeating until only one element is left in the unsorted subarray.
