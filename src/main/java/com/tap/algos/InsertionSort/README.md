# Insertion Sort Algorithm

# The algorithm is separating the array to subarrays of sorted and unsorted elements. The sorted subarray initially has the first element of the array. The algorithm is iterating through the unsorted subarray and checking if each element is lesser than each element in the sorted subarray and insert it at the right position, shifting all elements that are bigger with one position.
